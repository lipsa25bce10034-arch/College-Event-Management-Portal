1. Project Title:
College Event Management Portal

2. Problem Statement:
In most colleges, event information and registrations are handled through posters, WhatsApp groups, or manual forms. Because of this, students sometimes miss important updates, and organizers face difficulty keeping track of participants. This leads to confusion during registration, last-minute rush, and inaccurate participant lists. A simple online portal can make the whole process smoother for both students and organizers.

3. Objective of the Project:
To create a single place where students can check all upcoming events.
To make the registration process quick and easy.
To store all participant details neatly so organizers don’t have to manage paperwork.
To reduce manual errors and make event coordination more organized.

4. Proposed Solution / Project Idea:
The idea is to build a basic portal where college events can be posted with full details like date, time, venue, rules, and contact information. Students can open the event page, read the details, and register through a simple form. Once they submit the form, their entry will be saved in a structured list. This list can later be viewed or downloaded by the event coordinators for managing participants.

5. Key Features:
A main page showing all events
A separate page for each event
A form for student registration
Automatic storing of participant details
A clean confirmation message after successful registration
A simple interface that anyone can use


6. Expected Output:

Students will be able to join events through a simple online form.
Organizers will get a clean and accurate list of all the participants.
Event information will be easy to find and properly organized.

7. Tools and Technologies
Python

8. Limitations:
No admin login or editing options in the basic version.
Paid events cannot be handled without extra features.
If simple file storage is used, it won’t support very large data.
