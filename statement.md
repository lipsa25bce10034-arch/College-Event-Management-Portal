Managing college events manually often leads to confusion, miscommunication, and delays. Traditional methods such as handwritten registrations, physical announcements, and manual coordination between committees are inefficient and prone to errors. Students may miss important updates, organizers struggle to track participants, and maintaining event records becomes challenging.

The College Event Management System aims to solve these problems by providing a digital platform where events can be created, managed, updated, and tracked efficiently. The system ensures smooth coordination between organizers and participants, offering features like online event registration, automated notifications, schedule tracking, and digital record management.

This system reduces workload, eliminates paperwork, improves communication, and enhances the overall event experience for students and organizers. By centralizing all event-related activities, it promotes transparency, accessibility, and better planning for successful college events.
